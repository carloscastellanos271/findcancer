The metastatic spread of cancer cells (CTCs) from the primary tumor to distant sites leads to a poor prognosis in cancers originating from multiple organs. Functionalized biomaterial surfaces hold promise as a diagnostic tool to separate CTCs and potentially treat metastasis, utilizing antibody and selectin-mediated interactions for cell capture under flow. However, capture at high purity levels is challenged by the fact that CTCs are sparsely distributed in the bloodstream, with CTC concentrations as low as 1-100 cells/mL. Their seperation and isolation from blood is often reffered to as a "needle in a haystack problem", as white cells and red blood cells are present in concentrations of one million and one billion cells/mL of blood, respectively. Here, a straightforward program was written in java in order to distinguish between isolated CTCs and regular blood cells.
